Customer Journey Worksheet

Below is an example of a customer journey:
Phase 	Response to question 
Awareness 	Fleur is most receptive to purchasing the subscription we are offering when it is on sale so we want to make sure we bring it to light a couple of weeks before launch.
Interest	We want to emphasize imagery - make sure all images are bright and light, we want to emphasize that we are local and providing sustainable flowers. Also want to emphasize the subscription is fun and designed for all levels so it can take very little work or a lot of work depending on what Fleur wants and what fits in her life style.
Desire 	We want to show some stories of individuals with similar backgrounds and needs to Fleur as part of our ad so she can see that our product fits in her life.
Conversion 	We want to emphasize the initial sale of the subscription, perhaps an opportunity to test it out before committing so she has the flexibility but can enjoy the fun of the subscription.
Advocacy	We want to provide the best possible customer service, reach out for testimonials after Fleur starts using the subscription and provide opportunities for her engagement via Instagram in the form of posts she can like and share and questions she can answer and respond to. Also want to give her an opportunity to share sales and codes with her friends.
