K
Georgia, a core web font

		



The Georgia typeface was created by Tom Ricker, his design challenge was to create an “elegant & legible” typeface for on screen use.  He chose to make a transition from his typeface Verdana towards Times New Roman for the Microsoft Corporation, both were released in 1993. For example, taking the uppercase K  in Georgia, the strokes of the vertical meet at the upper stroke, without a gap while in Verdana and the News 706 fonts, the digital strokes meet at the ‘T’ , and when compared to the Times New Roman where the leg of the uppercase K has two serifs the Georgia font, has just  a single, right pointing serif, or foot, see LinkedIn article. 


 The typeface is inspired by 19th century print typeface, and is a reimagination of transitional serif designs, but it has a larger x-height and fewer fine details. Georgia shows several traditional features of "rational" serif typefaces from around the early 19th century, such as alternating thick and thin strokes, ball terminals and a vertical axis. It is a core font for web development, even if there is some restlessness towards other fonts like News 706 closer to Verdana
