About the assignments

There are four required assignments in this course. You will need to achieve a minimum grade of 75%  in each assignment in order to pass the course.

Note that assignments are not weighted equally. The first two assignments are short and simple and are weighted lightly. The last two are more complex and account for the majority of your grade.


### [Week 1 Assignment:](https://www.coursera.org/learn/image-making/home/welcome) Making Your Mood Board (15% of final grade)

Week 2 Assignment: Range of Representation (20% of final grade)

Week 3 Assignment: Composing Simple Spreads (30% of final grade)

Week 4 Assignment: Composing a Complex Narrative (in a book!) (35% of final grade)

In addition to completing each assignment you are required to review 3 of your peers, for a total of  12 reviews by the end of the course.

There are a couple of optional assignments throughout the course as well. Some are structured as assignments, while others are just prompts to encourage you to extend your imagemaking practice off-platform. I encourage you to try all them; note these will have no effect on your final grade.
